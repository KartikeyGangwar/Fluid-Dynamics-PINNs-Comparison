# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Fluid Dynamics
A comparative study of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving Viscous Burgers' equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes 2-D equations. Analyzing performance, convergence, and limitations.

## Currently In Progress 
This repository is under active development.
*   Phase 1: Burger's Equation - **COMPLETED** 
*   Phase 2: Navier-Stokes Equation - **COMPLETED** 
*   Phase 3: Comparative Analysis - In Progress

For solving we took, initial condition as u(x,0) = f(x) where f(x) is initial state of system so we took f(x) as -sin(pi*x) & Dirichlet boundary condition for Burgers' equation AND lid cavity experiment conditions for Navier-Stokes Equation.

The code for solving the Viscous Burger's and Navier-Stokes Equation is now available in the `src/` directory.
